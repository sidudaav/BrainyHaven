                    Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a term that describes symptoms of memory loss and thinking
                    ability. The greatest risk factors for dementia are age, genetics and smoking/alcohol use.
                    Unfortunately, there is no cure for this devastating illness yet; however, there are many ways one
                    can reduce their risk for dementia and even improve their memory. Dementia happens when there are
                    drastic, negative changes to the brain cells. This can severely affect the ability for the cells to
                    transmit signals and communicate with each other, causing a change in behavior and a decline in
                    reasoning skills and cognitive ability. Alzheimer’s disease, for example, is a common type of
                    dementia where the patient loses the ability to remember recent events.

                    The brain is an organ found in every human that controls the central nervous system. It is arguably
                    the most important and most complex part of the body. We wouldn’t be able to pick up a cup of coffee
                    or read the local newspaper in the morning without our brains. The brain is made up of nine parts,
                    each with their own functions and specialties; however, these parts work together all the time to
                    make sure their human runs well. The nine parts are shown below.
